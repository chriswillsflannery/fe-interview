# 1. Build out the app to meet the design spec jpg.
# 2. Using the Star Wars API, render 2 random characters.
# 3. The 'Fight' button should choose one of the two random characters.
# 4. The Winner should stay on the page, while the loser is replaced with a new random character. Also display some kind of messaging to say which character won.

# 5. Bonus: Build out translation functionality. Check out the translate function in utils. I want to be able to alert the app at top level whether we are in an english-speaking or spanish speaking locale, and all important copy on the page should display in that language.
